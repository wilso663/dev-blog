When redesigning my portfolio I had the idea in mind that the best way to continue to improve my skills was not just to keep making projects but also to explain how to a beginner developer as well my thought process behind why I chose that implementation. It dawned on me that beginners may benefit from reading how to implement certain things if they are stuck on a problem similar to mine. 

There are doubts of course, what if my implementation has been practices, what if there are updates to packages I used and now the correct implementation is totally different. However, being a connoisseur of many different technical articles, how to implement this or that feature, I've come to the conclusion that a lot of bloggers are not actually experts on the subject that they're writing about. Many of the articles I've read are very hard to follow, they require you to download a heap's worth of npm packages, but don't explain how they work, they give code that sometimes cause a syntax errors, or best of all jump over very important details between paragraphs and somewhere expect you to know how to fill in the gap, despite being inexperienced enough at to read an article on the subject. So, to correct some of these issues myself I will strive to be better than that that to me is a good enough justification to start. 

There can also be something said to learning by teaching. I believe this is commonly referred to as the Feynmann technique. That is to say, when you can explain how something works to someone else you also begin to understand it better. So, the development blog is not only to show my thought process and potentially help beginners, it's also clarify my thought process in a way that will improve my code quality over time. And I believe that many people can actually benefit from this way of learning. So I'd also encourage other developers. I believe they may benefit from teaching other people to do the same.
