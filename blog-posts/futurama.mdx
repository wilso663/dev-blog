# You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. __And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.__ *That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch.* If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

## She also liked to shut up!

How much did you make me? I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

1. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.
2. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
3. Hey, whatcha watching?

### She also liked to shut up!

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? You can see how I lived before I met you. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Oh, I think we should just stay friends.

* No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!
* I can explain. It's very valuable.
* Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.

Bender, you risked your life to save me! No, I'm Santa Claus! I can explain. It's very valuable. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Pansy. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Throw her in the brig. You are the last hope of the universe.

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? A sexy mistake. Guess again. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Anyone who laughs is a communist!

Why did you bring us here? That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Oh yeah, good luck with that. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Say it in Russian! I'm Santa Claus! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Take me to your leader! Bite my shiny metal ass. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Then we'll go with that data file!

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
