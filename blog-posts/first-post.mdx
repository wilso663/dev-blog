This will be the first time I've done this sort of thing, and by that I mean 
producing content for others to see. But, being able to see a project like this 
come to life from just an idea, to a mockup design in Figma, to code, and then 
product has been completely worth it.

The last 5% taking up 20% of the time turned out to be true on this project as well. 
Needing to implement ReCaptcha on my contact form, getting all the blog and portfolio 
data for the live site ready, retaking portraits, and getting articles written and
 proofread has taken way more time than I originally thought it would. There is a temptation to downplay the extra work of the non-technical, the writing or the small details of features like recaptcha and I certainly felt that this time. Whenn creating the original mock-up I thought " the articles have very little technical implementation, they can be done pretty quickly." I even left it as an abstract easy task and didn't bother to allocate time for it in my original estimates. Let's say yeah that's me I won't be making again. 

This portfolio isn't my first, but I decided to remake mine to the one you're seeing now because I got feedback that my previou one wasn't all that great. It has some issues with page responsiveness on my lightbox for the project section, and because I used a plugin instead of coding it myself, the issue couldn't be quickly fixed. I'd need to make the lightbox myself to have more control over it. Also the background design was a canvas that interferred with the readability of the page. Overall the portfolio was just not very impressive and because I used a few plugins that did some of the heavy lifting, it was difficult to say that the portfolio was completely my creation or that I could speak to how it worked. So, I decided to redo it all and implement many common blog/portfolio page features on it like pagination, responsive layouts, populating data from a server with my own API call, validating requests to the API calls, recaptcha on a contact form, etc. If you'd like to see the code for this website, I've put it into a public repository that you can find (https://www.github.com/wilso663/dev-blog)[here]. I'm open to feedback on the implementation and design, so feel free to contact me through the contact form on the portfolio page of this site if you have any suggestions.

What I have up next for this blog is to give a full write up on how many of the features were implemented, and after that, my next and upcoming development projects.
