I've been a fan of the Final Fantasy video game series since I was very young. The first game I ever played was Final Fantasy IX, which had a card game called Triple triad. And in it you had 5 rectangular cards with 4 values, one for each side, on a 3x3 tile. You could capture other cards when you placed them on your turn if any card they're adjacent to has a lower attack value on that adjacent side. The player with the most total cards when there are no tiles left to place cards wins. It was a simple game, but very fun as a side quest while playing through the main story of the game. There were several cards to collect in that game, and many other Final Fantasy games, and that's where this idea comes from.

In one of the latest Final Fantasy games, Final Fantasy XIV, the Massively Mutiplayer Online game, you can collect several hundreds of cards in the world and play against other human players. Keeping track of each one of those cards, and finding out specific details of how to acquire newer cards isn't always revealed in the game. So, players will often resort to using third party websites to find out how to get them. That's where this idea comes in. The features of the site will include, 1. A full list of cards that users can click on to mark as collected which will be saved in their localStorage. 
2. Information about where to acquire them and what patch the cards were added. 
3. Capability to sort the list by name, patch release date, rarity, and possibly more attributes. 
4. Search function to find a specific card by name.

Gamers tend to not like having to sign up with an email for a simple feature, so I'm limiting the data storage to localStorage in JavaScript.

I'm making this project since I believe it will not only be of use to some members in the Final Fantasy XIV game community, but also because it's not too substantial in scope, while keeping the need to learn about deploying a database for the card info, and implementing the API calls and search function. I feel that it is a good project to learn more about implementing and maintaining a Full stack service that people will use. It's also very possible to add on additional features and capabilities if desired at some point, so I think it is a good project to grow with.

The database deployment is the only question that is still up for debate. I had planned on Heroku, but their free tier is running out in November, which complicates things, since I'm not certain just how many people might be interested in using the service. It could be very few, or could explode into a few thousands or more visits per month, and I'm not certain of the cost just yet.

Keep an eye out if this sort of development interests you, I will be posting about the development of specific features and challenges that I find along the way. Stay tuned!
