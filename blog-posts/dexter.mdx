# I'm doing mental jumping jacks.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

I'm really more an apartment person. __I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!__ *I am not a killer.* I have a dark side, too.

## I'm really more an apartment person.

Watching ice melt. This is fun. God created pudding, and then he rested. I like seafood. Watching ice melt. This is fun.

1. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.
2. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.
3. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

### You all right, Dexter?

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

* Makes me a … scientist.
* I am not a killer.
* He taught me a code. To survive.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Cops, another community I'm not part of. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm really more an apartment person. You all right, Dexter? I'm partial to air conditioning.

You look…perfect. I have a dark side, too. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. You all right, Dexter?

I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I like seafood. You all right, Dexter? Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.

This man is a knight in shining armor. This man is a knight in shining armor. I am not a killer. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. He taught me a code. To survive. I'm really more an apartment person. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Like a sloth. I can do that.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. This man is a knight in shining armor. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. This man is a knight in shining armor. Only you could make those words cute. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Watching ice melt. This is fun.

Hello, Dexter Morgan. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. You all right, Dexter? I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm really more an apartment person. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.

Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

You all right, Dexter? Hello, Dexter Morgan. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? He taught me a code. To survive.
